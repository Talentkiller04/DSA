# Pseudocode
1. initailize bool isprime as true
2. divide n for i in 2 to n-1 if divisible even in any one case set isprime = false
3. return is prime that will be true if 2nd step iterations are never satisfied, and will return true if even one satisfies
# Other Approaches to Check Prime Numbers

When determining whether a given number is prime or not, there are several approaches and algorithms you can use. Here are some common methods to check if a number is prime:

1. **Trial Division:**
   - Check divisibility of the number by all integers from 2 to the square root of the number.
   - If the number is divisible by any integer in this range, it's not prime.

2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
   - Precompute primes up to a certain limit using a sieve.
   - Check if the given number is in the precomputed list of primes.
   - This method is efficient for multiple prime checks within a range.

3. **Fermat's Little Theorem:**
   - Use Fermat's Little Theorem to probabilistically determine if a number is prime.
   - This approach is probabilistic and may have false positives for composite numbers.

4. **Miller-Rabin Primality Test:**
   - A probabilistic algorithm to determine primality using modular exponentiation.
   - It's widely used in practice and can be tuned for desired accuracy.

5. **AKS Primality Test:**
   - A deterministic algorithm to determine primality in polynomial time.
   - Though efficient, it's often not used in practice due to its complexity.

6. **Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test:**
   - A deterministic primality-proving algorithm, specifically used for Mersenne numbers.

7. **Baillie-PSW Primality Test:**
   - A deterministic primality-proving algorithm based on arithmetic properties and strong pseudoprime tests.

8. **AKS Primality Test:**
   - A deterministic algorithm to determine primality in polynomial time.
   - Although efficient, it's not widely used in practice due to its complexity.

Choose the appropriate approach based on the constraints of your problem and the level of accuracy or efficiency required. For general-purpose primality checking, methods like trial division or probabilistic algorithms like Miller-Rabin are commonly used.
