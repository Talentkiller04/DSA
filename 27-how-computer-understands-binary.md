Computers understand binary, which is a base-2 numerical system, because the fundamental building blocks of computers, such as transistors and electronic circuits, can easily represent and operate using two states: on and off, or 1 and 0. These states align perfectly with the binary system, where 1 represents "on" or true, and 0 represents "off" or false.

Here's how computers interpret binary:

1. **Bit (Binary Digit)**:
   - The basic unit of information in a computer is a bit, which can be either 0 or 1. It's the smallest piece of data in binary representation.

2. **Bytes and Words**:
   - A group of 8 bits forms a byte. Bytes are commonly used as the basic unit for representing and manipulating data. Multiple bytes grouped together form words, which represent larger units of data.

3. **Representation of Numbers**:
   - Binary is used to represent numbers, where each position in a binary number represents a power of 2. Starting from the rightmost digit, each position corresponds to 2^n, where n is the position's index.

      For example:
      - \(1011_2\) in binary is \(1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0\), which is equal to \(11_{10}\) in decimal.

4. **Representation of Characters**:
   - In computing, characters (letters, numbers, symbols) are also represented using binary. Common encoding schemes like ASCII and Unicode assign unique binary patterns to each character.

5. **Instruction Execution**:
   - Machine language instructions are encoded in binary. The CPU interprets these binary instructions and performs the corresponding operations, such as arithmetic, logic, or data manipulation.

6. **Storage and Memory**:
   - Data stored in computer memory (RAM, hard drives, etc.) is represented in binary. Each byte of data is stored as a series of 8 bits, with each bit having a value of 0 or 1.

7. **Data Processing and Logic Operations**:
   - Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT) and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) are performed using binary arithmetic and logic gates, which are the basis of all computation in a computer.

Computers use electrical signals to represent these binary values (0 or 1), with voltages or states corresponding to these digits. Complex circuits and processors are designed to process and manipulate binary data efficiently, allowing computers to perform a wide array of tasks, from simple calculations to complex operations in software applications.
