Both "end of line character" and "newline" essentially refer to the same concept in different terms. Let's clarify both terms:

1. **End of Line Character**:
   - The "end of line character" refers to a special character (or characters) used to represent the end of a line of text in a file or a string.
   - Commonly represented as "\n" (newline character) in Unix-like operating systems and as "\r\n" (carriage return followed by newline) in Windows.

2. **Newline**:
   - "Newline" is a term used to describe the character or sequence of characters that moves the cursor or pointer to the beginning of the next line in a text file or string.
   - It's often represented by the "\n" character in many programming languages.

In practice, "newline" is a more commonly used and easily understood term, especially in the context of programming. Programmers generally refer to the "\n" character as the "newline" character when discussing formatting, input/output, and text manipulation.

So, if you're deciding between the two terms, "newline" is the more commonly used and recognized term within the programming community to describe the concept of a character that signifies the end of a line in a text file or string.
