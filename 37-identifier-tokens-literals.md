1. **Identifiers**:
   - **Definition**: An identifier is a name given to a program element, such as variables, functions, classes, etc., to uniquely identify them in a program.
   - **Rules for Naming Identifiers**:
     - Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
     - Can be followed by letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
     - Cannot be a keyword (reserved word).
     - Cannot contain spaces or special characters (except underscores).
   - **Example Identifiers**: `variableName`, `function_1`, `ClassA`.

2. **Tokens**:
   - **Definition**: Tokens are the smallest units of a program that have meaning. In programming languages, tokens can be identifiers, literals, operators, keywords, and punctuation symbols.
   - **Example Tokens**: `if` (a keyword), `123` (a numeric literal), `+` (an operator), `variableName` (an identifier).

3. **Literals**:
   - **Definition**: Literals are constant values that are used in a program. They represent fixed values that do not change during the program's execution.
   - **Types of Literals**:
     - **Numeric Literals**: Represent numbers (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers).
       - Example: `123`, `3.14`.
     - **String Literals**: Represent sequences of characters enclosed in double or single quotes.
       - Example: `"Hello, World!"`, `'A'`.
     - **Boolean Literals**: Represent true or false values.
       - Example: `true`, `false`.
     - **Null Literal**: Represents a null or empty value.
       - Example: `nullptr` (in C++).

4. **Keywords**:
   - **Definition**: Keywords are reserved words in a programming language that have special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers or for any other purpose.
   - **Examples of C++ Keywords**: `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `int`, `double`, `class`, `return`, `break`, `switch`, etc.
   - **Usage**: Keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of a program. For example, `if` is used to start a conditional block, and `int` is used to declare an integer variable.

In summary, identifiers are names given to program elements, tokens are the smallest units with meaning, literals are constant values, and keywords are reserved words with specific meanings in a programming language. Understanding and using these concepts is fundamental in writing and comprehending code in any programming language.
