`cout << "Anubhav";`, is a C++ code snippet using the Standard Library for output.

1. **`cout`**:
   - `cout` is the standard output stream in C++. It is an object of the `iostream` class, which represents the standard output device, typically the console or terminal.

2. **`<<` (Insertion Operator)**:
   - The `<<` operator in C++ is called the insertion operator. It is used to insert data into the output stream, in this case, the `cout` stream.

3. **`"Anubhav"`**:
   - `"Anubhav"` is a string literal, which is a sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes. In this case, it represents the text "Anubhav".

4. **Output to the Console**:
   - The `cout` stream, combined with the `<<` operator, is used to send the string "Anubhav" to the standard output (usually the console). The `<<` operator inserts the string into the `cout` stream, and it gets displayed on the console.

5. **Final Output**:
   - When this statement is executed, "Anubhav" is displayed on the console.

Putting it all together, `cout << "Anubhav";` instructs the program to output the string "Anubhav" to the standard output, typically the console, using the `cout` stream and the insertion operator (`<<`). This is a fundamental way to display information in C++ programs.
